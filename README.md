# CHS Review Site
By David Genis, Aviv Melamud, Marisol Kim, Bryan Park

The "CHS-Review-Site" program is our final project for the 2021-2022 school year of the Applied Computer Sciene. The motivation behind our project was to create an interactive review site regarding the classes provided at Cresskill High School. Students can choose from a variety of classes, provide a rating out of five stars, and write their own personal review about the chosen class. Every time a rating is submitted, the average number of stars is displayed on the screen for the users to see. The reviews are also listed for everyone to read.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python main.py`

The site will be available locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000
